# ToDo Compose App




## Description
The ToDo application should be in every developer's repository. Therefore, as a learning experience, I decided to put it on my repository as well.

* UI completely in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* Uses [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html)
* Uses [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
* Uses many of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), including: Room, DataStore, Navigation, ViewModel
* Uses [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
